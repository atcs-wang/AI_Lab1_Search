### HELPFUL NOTES ABOUT RELEVANT DATA STRUCTURES: ###

Python lists are fine to use as LIFO queues (aka stacks).
You might consider the append() and pop() methods.

However, python lists don't implement FIFO Queues very efficiently.
A "deque" (double-ended queue) improve on lists in this regard.
Consider the append(), appendleft(), pop(), and popleft() methods
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque

A PriorityQueue implemention is provided for you - see priorityqueue.py.
It uses the heapq module to implement a heap. You don't need to understand
heaps to use PriorityQueue, but you can read more here:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html

When implementing a filter (aka graph search), it may be helpful to use the Set class.
Sets are like python dictionaries, except they only store keys.
The "in" keyword invokes a key lookup.

"""
RandWalk is a provided search "algorithm". Attempts to find a path to the goal state from initial_state.
If a solution is found, returns the final StateNode, from which the path can be found.
If search fails/terminates early, returns None.

state_callback_fn is called on every "extended" (visited) StateNode.
Search terminates early if state_callback_fn returns True.

Also updates the counter dict with the num_extends (how many states are extended)
and num_enqueues (how may states are added to the frontier)

You should implement the following options
1) avoid backtracking (if avoid_backtrack = True)
2) filter extended states (if filtering = True)
3) cutoff search early at a given depth (cutoff)

Implement DFS, BFS, and UCS algorithms in a similar paradigm to the above.
You may find that all 3 are very similar...

Attempt to find a path to the goal state from initial_state.
If a solution is found, returns the final StateNode, from which the path can be found.
If search fails/terminates early, returns None.

state_callback_fn should be called on every "extended" (visited) StateNode.
Search should terminate early if state_callback_fn returns True.

Also updates the counter dict with the num_extends (how many states are extended)
and num_enqueues (how may states are added to the frontier)

You should implement the following options for each algorithm
1) avoid backtracking (if avoid_backtrack = True)
2) filter extended states (if filtering = True)
3) cutoff search early at a given depth (cutoff)
