Provide a slide puzzle heuristic tester and/or a list of correct hamming/manhattan values for the various slide puzzles

on GUI: Round the Est. Rem. Cost to Goal number to some number of decimal places

on GUI: optional display for Path Cost + Cost to Goal. Maybe, make each state detail an option?

Make a competition for best spotless heuristic? 


Grading notes for Lab 1:

Test on puzzle17: initial Manhattan should be 13, hamming should be 8

Misunderstanding of Anytime search, not correctly implemented. (-12)

Manhattan heuristic includes the empty tile, leading to A-star being incorrect on some tests (-5)

Graph search incorrectly adds enqueued things to the filter, rather than extended (-5).
